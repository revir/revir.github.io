It's really straightforward. It might be the simplest dictionary app on the browsers. So my goal is to make it support as many as languages in the world.
With Russian and Portuguese support, it might be a big step closer.

Please **notice**: as [Dictionariez] grows, more and more languages are added, if your target is just Portuguese or Russian, I suggest you cancel some other languages,
For example Italian and Spanish. Because They may have a lot of common words with Portuguese. You may get confusing definitions otherwise.

Go to settings, and cancel some languages checks.

So credit really goes to [Wiktionary], it's the source of not just Portuguese and Russian, but also a bunch of other languages like German and French. Beside of all the technical 
jargon, [Wiktionary] is a treasure trove. Thanks to it, dictionary for most languages is possible now.
