Hi everyone! I almost forgot to announce one of our biggest features... 😅

Translation Pro has actually been live since **v6.4.0**, and we're already at **v6.4.2**! I've been working like a machine recently, pushing updates so fast that I forgot to properly introduce this game-changing feature. Better late than never, right?

So let me officially introduce **Translation Pro** - the powerful text translation feature that's been quietly revolutionizing language learning for our users.

## What's New with Translation Pro?

Building on the success of our TTS Pro feature, Translation Pro uses the same intuitive interface but for instant translation:

- **Select any text on any webpage** and get instant translations
- **Support for 20+ major languages** with accurate AI-powered translations
- **Premium Google translation service** - superior quality to most providers
- **Same convenient bubble interface** - just look for the 🌐 icon
- **Works everywhere** - from news articles to social media posts

Whether you're learning a new language, reading foreign content, or just curious about what something means, Translation Pro makes it effortless.

## Superior Translation Quality

Translation Pro uses **Google's professional translation service** - the same technology powering Google Translate Pro. This means you get:

- **Higher accuracy** than most translation providers
- **Better context understanding** for natural translations  
- **Professional-grade quality** suitable for serious language learning
- **Consistent results** across all supported languages

The difference in quality is immediately noticeable, especially for complex sentences and technical content.

## How It Works

The user experience is beautifully simple:

1. **Select text** on any webpage (single words, sentences, or paragraphs)
2. **Press Ctrl** (or your configured key) to show the action bubble
3. **Click the translation icon** 🌐 to get instant translation
4. **View results** in a clean, non-intrusive popup
5. **Click the speaker icon** in the translation popup to hear it read aloud!

Just like TTS Pro, Translation Pro uses the same **isolated web component architecture** that ensures zero interference with the original website.

## Perfect for Language Learners

Translation Pro is designed with language learners in mind:

- **Learn vocabulary in context** - see how words are used in real sentences
- **Understand complex texts** - translate difficult passages instantly
- **Compare languages** - great for Swedish learners reading 8sidor or other native content
- **Pronunciation practice** - translate text, then have the translation read aloud with one click
- **High-quality learning** - professional-grade translations ensure you're learning correctly

## Technical Excellence & Design

Like all Dictionariez features, Translation Pro is built with quality in mind:

- **[Open source](https://github.com/pnlpal/dictionariez)** - you can explore the implementation
- **Web Components & Shadow DOM** - completely isolated from website scripts and styles
- **Auto theme adaptation** - automatically adapts to your OS light/dark theme
- **Universal compatibility** - works on all websites without interference
- **Premium Google translation API** - professional-grade translation quality

**Note**: While we've tested extensively, if you encounter any website compatibility issues, please [let us know](https://github.com/pnlpal/dictionariez/issues) so we can improve the experience.

## Language Support

Currently supporting **20+ major languages** including:
- English ↔ Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
- English ↔ Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Japanese, Korean
