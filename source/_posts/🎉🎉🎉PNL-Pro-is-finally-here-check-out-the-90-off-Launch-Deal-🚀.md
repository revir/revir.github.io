## ✨ Free Features Added Along the Way

While working on Pro, I didn’t stand still. In the meantime, I’ve added several highly requested features for everyone:

- 📖 **PNL Reader:** A brand-new tool to make any web page easier and prettier to read. Enjoy a distraction-free reading experience right in your browser!
- 📄 **PDF Reader:** Now fully compatible with Dictionariez, so you can look up words directly in PDFs. This was one of the most requested features from users, and I’m happy to deliver it for free.

These updates make the PNL platform more powerful and useful for all users, whether you’re using the free or Pro version.

## 🆕 What’s New in v6.0.0?

Here’s what’s included in the latest release:

- 🏅 **Introduced PNL Pro:** Unlock advanced features and support the project.
- ☁️ **Enabled cloud sync for local history (Pro users):** No more worrying about Chrome’s storage quota—sync unlimited words across devices.
- 🗑️ **Automatically remove oldest history items when exceeding Chrome storage quota:** For free users, your oldest words are now automatically managed so you don’t lose recent lookups.
- 🖱️ **Added `dblclick` option:** You can now choose to trigger lookup only on double-click, for more control.
- 🧐 **Improved word validation checks:** More accurate detection of valid words in any language.
- 🧪 **Expanded unit test coverage:** Even more reliable and robust.

## ☁️ Why Cloud Sync Matters

The main feature of PNL Pro right now is **Cloud Sync**. Chrome extensions have a strict storage quota, you can only save about 500 words before you start losing your oldest entries. With Cloud Sync, you get **unlimited word history**:
- 🚫 No more worrying about losing words you’ve looked up.
- 🔄 Your history and preferences are safely stored and accessible across all your devices.

## 🗺️ What’s Next? The Roadmap

PNL Pro is just getting started! Here’s what’s planned for the future:
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Definitions:** Get word definitions from advanced AI models. Since AI services have real costs, this feature will be part of the Pro plan.
- 🔊 **Read Out Loud with AI Pronunciation:** In PNL Reader, you’ll soon be able to have web content read aloud with natural AI voices — perfect for language learners and accessibility.
- Auto translate subtitles to your language on Captionz for any video. 

Your support as a Pro user will help make these features possible!
