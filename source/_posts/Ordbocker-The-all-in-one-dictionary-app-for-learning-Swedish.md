Hi, I hope you've had a great week of learning languages and coding! As someone learning Swedish myself, I know how tough it can be â€” especially if you're shy like me and feel awkward speaking with native speakers. Reading news articles? Even harder, with all the unfamiliar words.

Thatâ€™s exactly why I built [OrdbÃ¶cker]: an all-in-one dictionary app to make Swedish learning easier and less intimidating.

With OrdbÃ¶cker, you can instantly look up any word on a webpageâ€”just **double-click** it. Youâ€™ll get definitions from multiple trusted sources with one click on the icon. **Vocabulary** is the biggest challenge when reading Swedish newsâ€”thatâ€™s exactly what OrdbÃ¶cker helps with.

For example, my wife, whoâ€™s an intermediate learner, prefers **svenska.se** for Swedishâ€“Swedish definitions. Iâ€™m still a beginner, so I stick with **Glosbe**.

Here are some dictionaries I find helpful and set as default, but you can suggest more:
ðŸ”¹ Beginner-friendly:
Glosbe (Swedishâ€“English)
Reverso (context examples)
Captionz (YouTube examples)
ðŸ”¹ Intermediate:
Svenska.se (SAOL, SO, SAOBâ€”all in one)

OrdbÃ¶cker also lets you export your word history to **Anki flashcards** with just one clickâ€”super handy if youâ€™re serious about remembering what youâ€™ve learned.

If you havenâ€™t tried Anki yet, itâ€™s a fantastic app that helps you review words over time using **spaced repetition** (a fancy way of saying it reminds you just before youâ€™re about to forget).

Honestly, Anki is my secret weapon for learning languages. I owe half my Swedish vocabulary to itâ€”and now with OrdbÃ¶cker, adding new words takes less effort.

Swedish verbs change differently, so I also wanted it to find the root form of wordsâ€”not all dictionary tools can do that. Certainly [Dictionariez] is more focused on English, and donâ€™t really prioritize Swedish. For example, when I look up the word fart, I want the Swedish meaning to show up first in OrdbÃ¶cker.

If youâ€™re already using Dictionariez and mainly learning Swedish through English, I recommend switching to OrdbÃ¶cker. It offers most of the same features but prioritizes Swedish over English.

My tip? Donâ€™t take on too many new words at onceâ€”stay **motivated**, not overwhelmed.
Focus on words you actually see and hear often. Itâ€™s more useful to really know 10 common words than to half-remember 100 rare ones.

When you add words to Anki, keep the cards simple. Just the word, a short definition, maybe an example sentence. If a card feels like homework, youâ€™ll end up skipping it.

Try to review a little bit every day. Even 5â€“10 minutes of Anki goes a long wayâ€”**consistency** really is the secret.

And remember, you donâ€™t have to understand everything right away. Getting the general idea is already a win!

If you try out OrdbÃ¶cker, Iâ€™d love to hear what you think. Got suggestions, ideas, or something thatâ€™s not working? Your **feedback** helps me make it better for everyone learning Swedish!
