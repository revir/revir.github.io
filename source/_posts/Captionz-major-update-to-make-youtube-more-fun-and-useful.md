Hej! Hope you had an awesome weekend.

Just wanted to share an update I’m really excited about: I’ve been working on [Captionz], and it just got a major upgrade! 🎉 It now supports language-specific search, which means you can search for words spoken in a particular language inside YouTube videos.

Try it here 👉 [https://pnl.dev/captionz](https://pnl.dev/captionz)

So, for example—if you’re learning Swedish like I am—you can type in any Swedish word (or English word?), and [Captionz] will show you YouTube videos where people are actually speaking Swedish. No more digging through irrelevant content. It’s like turning YouTube into your own personal language-learning search engine.

### Ever tried using YouTube to learn a language?
Maybe you're following some cool SFI teachers or native speakers on YouTube—maybe it’s French, Spanish, Japanese, whatever. That’s awesome, but YouTube doesn’t really give you good tools to learn from those videos, right? That's where Captionz comes in. It’s made specifically for language learners who want to use real, native content to study smarter.

Here’s what it can do:

* **Dual subtitles**? Yep. See both the original language and your native language side-by-side. Super helpful for understanding context and structure.

* **A-B repeat**? You got it. Replay a sentence or phrase over and over until it sticks. (Yes, it’s that good ol’ A-to-B loop feature from back in the day!)

* **Search** any word or phrase? Big yes. Want to hear how native speakers say “hej då” or “ça va”? Search it and boom—real people saying it in real videos.

* Add **notes**? Kind of. Right now, you can add notes during the video, and they’ll **fly across** the screen like flying bullets. It’s a fun start, but still in development—private notes and better note management are on the roadmap.

### Why this matters
This project really means a lot to me. I love YouTube, and I genuinely believe it’s one of the best tools for language learning. There’s always someone out there creating exactly what you need to hear or see—you just need a better way to find it. That’s the whole idea behind Captionz.

Whether you're just starting out or you're already deep into your language journey, I hope [Captionz] makes it easier, more interactive, and honestly, more fun.

*A few quick tips to get the most out of Captionz*
1. Use dual subtitles to compare sentence structure and learn natural phrasing.

2. Loop tricky sentences with A-B repeat and shadow them until they sound natural.

3. Search new words you encounter in lessons and see how they’re actually used by native speakers.

4. Follow channels in your target language and combine them with Captionz for a powerful study combo.

Thanks for reading this far! 😄 I’d love for you to try it out and let me know what you think. More features are in the works, and your feedback helps shape where this goes next.

**By the way—what language are you learning right now? And do you have a favorite YouTube channel for it? Comment under the topic. I’m always looking for good recommendations!**

Happy learning!
