Dear Netizens and Web Novel Enthusiasts,

I’m excited to announce that PNL Reader is finally here! After a week of development sprint, it just hits the first milestone, and I’m already using it to read a novel myself. It’s a browser extension designed to make your reading experience smoother, more enjoyable, and relaxing. Whether you're diving into articles, novels, or any other web content, PNL Reader has your back with its simple yet elegant features.

This all started from [a thread](https://pnl.dev/topic/914/why-dictionariez-does-not-recognize-selected-text-in-reader-focus-mode) discussing the frustration many face when looking for a no-nonsense, simple reader mode that also plays nice with Dictionariez and respects privacy. So, I decided to create my own solution. Keep in mind this is the first version, so please be patient if you encounter any bugs.

Here’s a quick rundown of the features based on my own experience as an novel reader online:

## Key Features
1. **Dictionariez Compatibility**
Instantly look up any word on a webpage by simply clicking on it. PNL Reader is fully compatible with Dictionariez for seamless word lookup.

2. **Privacy-First Approach**
Your privacy is a priority. PNL Reader only requires the **ActiveTab** permission to enable reader mode on the current webpage you’re on, with no additional host permissions required.

3. **Dark & Light Mode**
Switch between dark and light modes depending on your preference, so you can reduce eye strain and read comfortably at any time of day.

4. **Navigation Shortcuts**
Easily navigate through your favorite web novel websites, like Scribble and RoyalRoad, using convenient keyboard shortcuts for next and previous pages.

5. **Open Source**
Full transparency is key. PNL Reader is [open source], so it’s available for anyone to review, contribute to, or scrutinize as they wish.

As I am preparing for the second version of PNL Reader, here are a few specific areas where your feedback would be incredibly helpful:

1. Which websites would you like to use the reader mode on?
2. What more themes (beyond just dark or light) would you like?
3. Are there any additional features you’d like to see in the toolbar?
4. In your opinion, what are the essential features every reader must have?

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to improving PNL Reader based on your valuable feedback!
