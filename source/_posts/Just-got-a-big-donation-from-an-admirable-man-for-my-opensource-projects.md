What a sunny day here! Today when I got up my Gmail and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drchuck/status/1350895184117178369) both notified me that I have got a donation. And it's not just a cup of coffee. It turns out to be a whole bunch of coffees.

That's really huge to me. Not just for the amount of money, but also for someone's appreciation, especially from a man who is so influential and admirable in the open-source society.   
I don't really know him, in fact I just googled him when I saw this. (I am a totally newbie in the modern world.)

I found out that [He is someone really dedicated to educational purpose](https://www.dr-chuck.com).   

He is working on the open-source project of [Sakai Collaboration and Learning Environment](https://github.com/sakaiproject).    
He has been teaching online since a long time ago and do it for free!

How cool he is! 

Though I have been working on my own open source projects for a while now, never thought I could do the great things like him. 

For example [Dictionariez] started as a small sideline when I started to recognize my English really needs to improve. I just collected a series of free online dictionaries and put them together. It works for me so I hope it also works for others. 

And [Captionz] is just a really small tool to watch YouTube with more fun. 

I am so glad that people like them, and they are proved to be really helpful!  

This article is for this man, whom has given me the greatest incentive to do my projects continually, and made the possibility come true. 

This article is also for the indie developers out there, who are trying to make the world a better place. The possibility is real. You can do it even it's small. You can help others. You might even start a career with it.

Yes, programming is fun, right?
