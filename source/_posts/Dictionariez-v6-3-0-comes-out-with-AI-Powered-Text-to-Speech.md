Hi everyone! I'm thrilled to announce that the powerful text-to-speech player from PNL Reader has now been integrated into Dictionariez. This exciting new feature makes language learning more accessible and convenient than ever before.

## What's New?

With **TTS Pro**, you can now:

- **Select any text on any webpage** and have it read aloud instantly
- **Support for multiple languages** with realistic AI voices
- **High-quality pronunciation** that surpasses many existing solutions
- **Seamless integration** that works across all websites

For Swedish learners specifically, I'm confident you'll find our AI voices significantly better than what's available on 8sidor and other platforms. The natural intonation and pronunciation make it perfect for improving your listening comprehension and pronunciation skills.

## The Technology Behind It

As always, **[Dictionariez remains open-source](https://github.com/pnlpal/dictionariez)**, so you can explore the implementation yourself on our GitHub repository. Here's what makes this feature special:

- **Web Components Architecture**: I've wrapped the entire TTS player using web components with shadow DOM
- **Complete Isolation**: The player operates independently from the host website's context
- **No Interference**: Scripts and styles from the original website won't affect Dictionariez, and vice versa
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across all websites, including complex applications like Epic Games login pages

This technical approach ensures reliability and compatibility while maintaining the integrity of both the original website and our extension.

## Pricing and Availability

Since TTS Pro utilizes premium AI services that incur costs per request, this feature is included in our **PNL Pro plan**. However, I believe in letting you experience the quality first-hand, so I've included a **generous free trial** for everyone.

### ⚡ Last Hours of 11.11 Offer!

**Hurry!** The **11.11 special offer with 80% off** is ending in just a few hours! Don't miss out on this amazing deal.
